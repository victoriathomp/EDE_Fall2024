# 1. INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 Lesson Objectives

-   Discuss the importance of location in environmental data analysis
-   Examine how spatial features are stored in R: "Simple Features" and the `sf` package
-   Review coordinate reference systems (CRS) and discuss their importance
-   Examine a simple spatial analysis using the `sf` package


## 1.2 Discussion: The importance of location in environmental data analysis

-   Utility of joining dataframes to explore relations across observations.
-   But what if the dataframes have no field in common?
-   As most environmental data are linked to a location: join data spatially!
-   Spatial analysis allows that, and so much more.


## 1.3 Discussion: Spatial Data models
-   Raster data model: landscape as pixels with values (not covered here)
-   Vector data model: points, lines, polygons (what we will discuss)


## 1.4 Setup: Installing the necessary packages

The packages we'll need for this lesson are below. 
Install as necessary and ensure they can each be imported without error.

```{r Install packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#Import the familiar libraries
library(tidyverse); library(lubridate); library(here)

#install.packages('sf')
library(sf)
#install.packages('leaflet')
library(leaflet)
#install.packages('mapview')
library(mapview); mapviewOptions(fgb = FALSE)

#Disable on-the-fly projections
sf::sf_use_s2(FALSE)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 2. REPRESENTING SPATIAL DATA IN R

## 2.1 Reading data into R using the `sf` package

-   Use `st_read()` to read in spatial data formats (Shapefile, GeoJSON)
-   Explore as a typical dataframe
-   Explore as a *spatial* dataframe

```{r Read in road data}
#Read the GeoJSON file into a spatial dataframe
GasPlants <- st_read(here('Data/Spatial/Manufactured_Gas_Plant_Sites.geojson'))

#Explore as a typical dataframe
class(GasPlants)
glimpse(GasPlants)
str(GasPlants$geometry)

#Explore as a spatial dataframe...
#View using sf plot
plot(GasPlants['status'],pch=16)

#View using ggplot
ggplot(data=GasPlants) + geom_sf(aes(color=status))

#View using mapview
mapview(GasPlants, zcol='status')

```

## 2.2 The spatial data frame 

### 2.2.1 SF and the Vector Data Model

The `sf` package embraces the vector data model, meaning spatial features are represented as points, lines, or polygons. To do this, the package introduces a new data type to the coding environment - the **geometry** data type. Geometries are comprised of coordinate pairs that form to create **geometric objects**. These can be:

-   **points** - created from a single coordinate pair;
-   **lines** - created from a sequence of coordinate pairs representing the start, the end, and any vertex along the line (i.e. where it changes direction); and
-   **polygons** - also created from a sequence of coordinate pairs, but where the first and last pair are in the same location, thus closing the shape and defining an area.

These geometries represent features located in geographic space. (There are other geometry types, with a full set listed [here](https://bit.ly/3hrPcZO).However, to keep things simple, we'll focus on points, lines, and polygons.)

## 2.2.2 Anatomy of a spatial dataframe
-   **Simple feature object (sf)**: the "spatial dataframe"
-   **Simple feature**: one row in the sf collection
-   **Simple feature column (sfc)**: the column containing geometries
-   **Simple feature geometry (sfg)**: a single geometric object
-   **Coordinate reference system (CRS)**: [more on this in a bit]

## EXERCISE: Creating a spatial dataframe from coordinate columns
Now that we know the components of a spatial dataframe, we can explore how to construct one from from data vs reading in existing spatial data files. 

-   The first exercise below shows the procedure for converting an existing dataframe with coordinate data (lat/lng) into a spatial dataframe simply by indicating which column contain the coordinate data. (Note this works only for point features.)
-   The second exercise shows the steps for creating an individual single geometry (sfg) from a coordinate pair, creating a new sfc and adding our sg to it, and finally generating a spatial dataframe from this. 

```{r Create a spatial dataframe from coordinate data}

#Read in our processed EPA Air dataset, setting the Date column to be dates
EPAair <- read.csv(
  here("Data/Processed_KEY/EPAair_O3_PM25_NC1819_Processed.csv"), 
  stringsAsFactors = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(Date = ymd(Date))


#Wrangle so each site has only one record, computing mean ozone and PM2.5
EPAair.sites <- EPAair %>% 
  group_by(Site.Name, COUNTY, mean_Lat, mean_Lng) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_Ozone = mean(Ozone, na.rm=T), #What does "na.rm=T" do? Is it necessary?
    mean_PM25 = mean(PM2.5, na.rm=T),
    count_all = n(),                   #Adds a record count column
    count_Ozone = sum(!is.na(Ozone)),  #Counts the rows w/Ozone data
    count_PM25 = sum(!is.na(PM2.5))    #Counts the rows w/PM2.5 data
    )

#Convert to a spatial dataframe
EPAair.sf <- EPAair.sites %>% 
  st_as_sf(
    coords = c('mean_Lng','mean_Lat'),
    crs=4326
    )

#Save locally as a shapefile 
st_write(
  EPAair.sf,
  here("./Data/Processed/EPAair_sites.shp"),
  driver='ESRI Shapefile'
  )

#View the sf object using the methods above...

```


## EXERCISE: Creating a spatial dataframe from known coordinates
-   Create a point geometry from coordinates -> `sg`
-   Convert the point (and `crs`) to a simple feature column -> `sfc`
-   Insert the `sfc` into a sf, along with attributes -> `sf`

```{r Create a spatial dataframe from scratch}
#First create a simple feature geometry object ("sfg")
sfg_GraingerHall <- st_point(c(-78.9427,36.00465))
class(sfg_GraingerHall)
mapview(sfg_GraingerHall)

#Upgrade to a simple feature geometry column by adding a crs 
sfc_GraingerHall <- st_sfc(sfg_GraingerHall,crs=4326)
class(sfc_GraingerHall)
mapview(sfc_GraingerHall)

#Upgrade to a spatial dataframe
sf_GraingerHall <- st_as_sf(sfc_GraingerHall)
sf_GraingerHall$Name = 'Grainger Hall'
mapview(sf_GraingerHall)

```

## 2.3 Summary

So, we see that our "sf" dataframe works much like our familiar dataframe, only it has a new column containing *geometries* for each record. This pretty much sums up what a GIS is: a familiar table of records and attributes (i.e. an "Information System"), but with one attribute that includes a geometry that allows us to incorporate geography into our analysis (i.e. a "*Geographic* Information System")!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 3. COORDINATE REFERENCE SYSTEMS

Each of the above datasets we explored use lat/long coordinates in defining their geometries. We actually specify that these use lat/long coordinate when creating them via the `crs = 4326` parameter you see in the examples. But what is "4326"?? And what is the significance of this?

Let's explore:

## EXERCISE: Buffering - a simple spatial analyis

"Buffering" a simple feature extends the area outward a specified distance. The code below buffers Grainger Hall 1 "unit".

```{r buffer Grainger hall}
#Buffer Grainger Hall 1 unit
the_buffer <- sf_GraingerHall %>% st_buffer(1)

#View the result
mapview(the_buffer)
```

A bit odd, no? Why is the circle so big? What is the units of '1'? And why is it oval, not a circle? This has much to do with the fact that the geometric units of our feature are measured in angular units (degrees) and not familiar planar ones (like meters or feet). And that's because latitude and longitude measure location on a sphere, and we like doing calculations on a plane...

```{r crs of our sf}
#View the coordinate reference system (crs) of our sf object
st_crs(sf_GraingerHall)
```

## 3.1 What is a `crs`?
-   Specifies the **origin** of the x & y coordinates of our geometries (0,0)
-   Specifies the linear unit of the x & y coordinates
    -   **Geographic coordinate systems** use angular units: latitude/longitude
    -   **Projected coordinate systems** use Cartesian units: meters, feet
-   References a model of the earth to minimize distortion 
    -   Earth is not perfect sphere! 
    -   Shape of earth represented by "geoids", "ellipsoids" & "datums"
    
## 3.2 Importance of `crs`; why so many? 
-   `crs` provides a "common denominator" to allow us to combine spatial data
-   `crs` are regionally accurate, globally distorted
    - Because the earth is not a perfect sphere or easily represented as one
    - Flattening the earth, needed for measuring distances, introduces more distortion 
-   Thus we chose a `crs` that's most appropriate for our study area
-   Different `crs` types used to reduce types of distortion
    - **Conformal**: Preserve local shapes
    - **Equidistant**: Preserve distance
    - **Equal-Area**: Preserve area

## 3.3 Working with `crs`
-   They can be confusing, but they are also important in avoiding distortion
-   `crs` take the form of a single "ESPG" code or a "Proj4" string
    - "EPSG" = database of projections <https://epsg.io/>
    - "Proj4" string = enter projection info explicitly
-   Use `st_transform()` to convert sf objects from one crs to another
-   Best practice is to get all spatial data using the same `crs`
    - And use a projected crs if you are computing areas, distances, etc.


### 3.3.1 Some commonly used CRS

**EPSG:4326**

WGS 84 or WGS84 (World Geodetic System 1984, used in GPS) <http://epsg.io/4326>

**EPSG:102008**

NAD83 / North America Albers Equal Area Conic <http://epsg.io/102008>

**EPSG:various UTM**

Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) You need to find your UTM zone and then determine EPSG from there. To look up your zone go to [this website](https://mangomap.com/robertyoung/maps/69585/what-utm-zone-am-i-in-#).

### 3.4.2 A Quick Reference for CRSs in R

National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis created a CRS summary sheet. Useful quick reference as well as background if you don't have much knowledge of all the various choices presented.

## EXERCISE: Spatial Analysis

Say we want to the distance between our EPA sites and the nearest Gas Plant. We don't want to report the distances in degrees, so we first want to project our data into a projected crs. We'll use the UTM Zone 17 N - WGS84 crs (EPSG = 32617)

```{r Transform the dataset}
#Transform the datasets to use UTM 17 N, WGS84
EPAair.sf.utm <- st_transform(EPAair.sf,32617)
GasPlants.utm <- st_transform(GasPlants,32617)

#Have a look at the coordinate associated with the geometries
EPAair.sf.utm$geometry[1]

#Plot the data
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = EPAair.sf.utm,color='blue') + 
  geom_sf(data = GasPlants.utm,color='red',shape='O') 

#Create a distance matrix between the point in each dataset
distance_matrix <- st_distance(EPAair.sf.utm, GasPlants.utm, pairwise=T)
dim(distance_matrix)

#Compute the mean of each row (each EPA site)
mean_distances <-  rowMeans(distance_matrix)

#Compute min distances
min_distances <- apply(
  distance_matrix,
  MARGIN=1, #1=rows; 2=columns
  FUN=min   #Function to apply
  )

#Add as a column to the epa sites
EPAair.sf.utm  <-  EPAair.sf.utm %>% 
  bind_cols("AvgDistToGasPlant" = mean_distances) %>% 
  bind_cols("MinDistToGasPlant" = min_distances)

```
